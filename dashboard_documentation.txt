✅ Setup Complete!
I've successfully set up the dashboard command on your machine. You can now launch and control your Family Dashboard by simply typing dashboard into the terminal.
Available Commands:
dashboard start - Start both the storage-server and web-app
dashboard stop - Stop all dashboard services
dashboard restart - Restart the dashboard
dashboard status - Check if services are running
dashboard logs - View live logs from both services
dashboard storage - Check storage server health
dashboard backup - Create a data backup
What I did:
✅ Installed Node.js v20.19.5 and npm v10.8.2
✅ Installed dependencies for both storage-server and web-app
✅ Created ~/dashboard-control.sh with proper paths
✅ Created symlink at /usr/local/bin/dashboard for global access
✅ Tested and verified both services are running
Currently Running:
✅ Storage server: http://localhost:3001
✅ Web app: http://localhost:19006
You can access the web app by opening http://localhost:19006 in your browser!
